An end-run around currently broken Alpine GIS libraries.

Useful as a base build for a GeoDjango app, especially in combination
with the [mdillon/postgis](https://hub.docker.com/r/mdillon/postgis/) 
image, upon which this is partially based.

I use it in combination with a lightly modified 
[cookiecutter django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django)
template for prototyping GeoDjango projects.
